SLIM and SSLIM TOY implementation
----------

We have implemented SLIM [1]_ and SSLIM [2]_ (more specifically cSLIM) in a "toy" way, that's useful ONLY to study these methods, it is absolutely impossible to use these implementations on production, because of performance and some static aspects put on the code. 

We've also implemented some new ideias to extend these methods in some specific cases.
